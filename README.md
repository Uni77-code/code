# Repository Description:

This Repo contains a small selection of sample code taken from my dissertation project. There are a handful of code snippets for each of the three research questions: 
RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3, that were used in this project - to show as an example of the work carried out for the project. 

This is by no means a repo displaying the full extent of the code that I developed during the many refactoring sessions that were necessary in order to complete this project. This repo only serves the purpose of providing a sample of the work carried out, for the purpose of tutor review. These code samples were not part of the final summative assessment and therefore weren't graded.
